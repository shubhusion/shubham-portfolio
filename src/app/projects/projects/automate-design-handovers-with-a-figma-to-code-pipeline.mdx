## Problem Statement
Manual design handoff from Figma to code was slow, error-prone, and inconsistent across teams.

## System Architecture
- Custom Figma plugin extracts design tokens and exports them for direct code integration.
- Automated pipeline maps Figma components to React, handling responsive layouts and edge cases.
- CI/CD pipeline syncs Figma changes to the codebase with robust error handling.
- Scalable design system as a single source of truth for design and engineering.

## Engineering Challenges
- Ensuring generated code is clean, maintainable, and production-ready.
- Mapping complex Figma structures to reusable React components.
- Handling continuous synchronization and error recovery in CI/CD.

## Impact
- Reduced design-to-development time by 40%.
- Improved code maintainability and design fidelity.
- Enabled instant, automated updates from design to production.

## Tech Stack
Figma API, Node.js, React, Next.js, Styled-Components, GitHub Actions
